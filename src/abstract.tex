    We propose a base-layer publication protocol for a permissionless, censorship-resistant, and decentralized network. The protocol is based on a directed acyclic graph (DAG) and is designed to be used as a base-layer for a decentralized social network. The protocol is designed to be used in a permissionless setting, where anyone can publish messages into the network. The protocol is designed to be resistant to censorship and denial of service attacks. 

    We propose a new consensus algorithm, called proof of review. In Lakat this algorithm is used to propose new states of a branch. It consists of review and a 
    finality algorithm. We also propose a new finality algorithm, called lignification.
