I would like to thank Mahdi Kourehpaz for discussions and being a great critical mind and I would like to thank Andrei Taranu for discussions, support and for poking the idea here and there. Furthermore I appreciated the opportunity to present this idea at a workshop organized by the Basic Research Community in Physics in Spetember 2022, which provided a stimulating environment for discussion and feedback. In particular I am grateful for discussions with Benjamin Bose, Louis Garbe, Bernadette Lessel and Markus Penz. Finally I would also like to thank the Urbiter $\sim$dachus-tiprel for very insightful discussions in San Salvador and for the Urbit community to provide a great environment for discussions.
