# The Lakat Whitepaper

## Summary
Lakat is a base layer for a publishing system that fosters collaboration, pluralism and permissionless participation. Drawing inspiration from the philosophy of Imre Lakatos, Lakat is designed as a peer-to-peer process- and conflict-oriented system that supports continuous integration across multiple branches.
